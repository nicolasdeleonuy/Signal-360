# Product Vision for Signal-360

## 1. Core Product Objective
[cite_start]Signal-360 is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) investment and trading analysis tool[cite: 15]. [cite_start]Its primary goal is to unify four distinct analysis applications into a single, automated web platform[cite: 16]. [cite_start]The product must provide a holistic view (Fundamental, Technical, ESG) of a financial asset to eliminate manual data entry, save time, and empower users to make faster, more informed decisions[cite: 17].

## 2. Target Audience
[cite_start]The user is an English-speaking investor or trader, either retail or professional[cite: 18]. [cite_start]They are technically savvy and are looking to optimize their analysis process by leveraging a 360-degree view of an asset[cite: 18].

## 3. Key Features (MVP)
- [cite_start]**Unified Analysis by Ticker:** The user inputs a ticker, and the app automatically performs Fundamental, Technical, and ESG analysis[cite: 21, 22].
- [cite_start]**Guided Decision Flow:** After the analysis, the user specifies their goal ("Long-term Investment" or "Short-term Trading") to get a correctly weighted verdict[cite: 25, 27].
- [cite_start]**Synthesized Interactive Verdict:** The app presents a final score (0-100) and a clear breakdown of "Convergence" and "Divergence" factors[cite: 30, 31].
- [cite_start]**Secure API Key Management:** Users can securely manage their own Google API Key in a profile section[cite: 33, 34].

## 4. Long-Term Vision
[cite_start]The ultimate vision is to evolve from a hackathon project into a robust, commercial SaaS product that becomes a reference tool in the AI-assisted investment analysis market[cite: 19].
