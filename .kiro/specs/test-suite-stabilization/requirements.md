# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the stabilization of the test suite after the Jest to Vitest migration. During the migration of page test files in Task 2, several tests began failing due to component behavior issues, not migration problems. These failing tests represent technical debt that must be resolved to ensure a stable and reliable test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all migrated test files to have passing tests, so that the test suite provides reliable feedback on code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests for sign-up.test.tsx THEN all 12 tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN running tests for profile-protected-route.test.tsx THEN all 8 tests SHALL pass  
3. WHEN running tests for auth-pages-integration.test.tsx THEN all 5 tests SHALL pass
4. WHEN running tests for login-integration.test.tsx THEN all 7 tests SHALL pass
5. WHEN running the complete test suite THEN there SHALL be zero failing tests in migrated page files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test failures to be resolved without breaking existing functionality, so that components continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing test failures THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing component functionality
2. WHEN updating test assertions THEN the system SHALL maintain the original test intent
3. WHEN modifying components THEN the system SHALL not introduce new bugs or regressions
4. WHEN resolving test issues THEN the system SHALL use appropriate testing patterns for the identified problems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear identification of test failure root causes, so that fixes target the actual problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test failures THEN the system SHALL categorize failures by root cause type
2. WHEN multiple elements exist with same text THEN the system SHALL use more specific selectors
3. WHEN components have timing issues THEN the system SHALL implement proper async handling
4. WHEN mocks are incorrectly configured THEN the system SHALL fix mock setup and behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test fixes to follow Vitest best practices, so that the test suite is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating test code THEN the system SHALL use Vitest-specific patterns and APIs
2. WHEN fixing async tests THEN the system SHALL use proper waitFor and async/await patterns
3. WHEN updating selectors THEN the system SHALL prefer semantic queries over generic text queries
4. WHEN configuring mocks THEN the system SHALL use Vitest mock patterns correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage maintained, so that all critical functionality remains tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing tests THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve test coverage
2. WHEN updating test assertions THEN the system SHALL ensure all edge cases remain covered
3. WHEN modifying test setup THEN the system SHALL preserve test isolation and independence
4. WHEN resolving failures THEN the system SHALL not remove or skip important test scenarios
