# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements reusable chart components for data visualization in the Signal-360 dashboard. The components will provide interactive charts for displaying analysis results using the recharts library, ensuring consistency with the established technical stack and maintaining isolation for future integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable AnalysisChart component, so that I can display various types of analysis data consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AnalysisChart component is created THEN it SHALL be located at `src/components/charts/AnalysisChart.tsx`
2. WHEN the component is implemented THEN it SHALL use exclusively the recharts library for all chart rendering
3. WHEN the component is defined THEN it SHALL have a TypeScript interface for its props
4. WHEN the component receives props THEN it SHALL accept at least `data` (array of data objects) and `chartType` ('line' | 'bar' | 'composed')
5. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL use ResponsiveContainer as the root element for adaptability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chart component to support multiple chart types, so that I can display different kinds of analysis data appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chartType is 'line' THEN the component SHALL render a LineChart from recharts
2. WHEN chartType is 'bar' THEN the component SHALL render a BarChart from recharts
3. WHEN chartType is 'composed' THEN the component SHALL render a composed chart with both line and bar elements
4. WHEN any chart type is rendered THEN it SHALL include CartesianGrid, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, and Legend components
5. WHEN the component loads THEN it SHALL display placeholder data for visualization testing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chart component to be properly typed and structured, so that it integrates seamlessly with the TypeScript codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is implemented THEN it SHALL import all necessary recharts modules (ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, BarChart, CartesianGrid, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, Line, Bar)
2. WHEN the component is defined THEN it SHALL have strong TypeScript typing for all props and internal data structures
3. WHEN the component is created THEN it SHALL include hardcoded placeholder data for initial testing
4. WHEN the component is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the project's established file naming and structure conventions
5. WHEN the component is complete THEN it SHALL remain isolated without integration into existing views

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chart component to be responsive and accessible, so that it works well across different screen sizes and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL use ResponsiveContainer to ensure proper scaling
2. WHEN the chart displays data THEN it SHALL include proper accessibility attributes for screen readers
3. WHEN the component is styled THEN it SHALL follow the project's design system and color scheme
4. WHEN tooltips are shown THEN they SHALL display meaningful information about the data points
5. WHEN the component is rendered THEN it SHALL maintain consistent spacing and layout principles
