# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Signal-360 codebase currently has 74 TypeScript errors that need to be systematically resolved to ensure code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity. This feature focuses on eliminating all TypeScript compilation errors while maintaining existing functionality and test coverage. The goal is to achieve a clean TypeScript compilation state with zero errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a codebase with zero TypeScript errors, so that I can work efficiently without compilation warnings and have confidence in type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit --project .` THEN the system SHALL complete without reporting any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN the TypeScript compiler analyzes the codebase THEN it SHALL find zero type-related issues
3. WHEN developers work on the codebase THEN they SHALL have full IntelliSense support and type checking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused imports and variables removed, so that the codebase is clean and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test files THEN the system SHALL NOT contain unused React imports in files that don't use JSX
2. WHEN analyzing any file THEN the system SHALL NOT contain unused variable declarations
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS6133 (unused declaration) errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function parameters to have explicit types, so that type safety is maintained throughout the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining callback functions in tests THEN the system SHALL have explicit parameter types
2. WHEN using mock implementations THEN all callback parameters SHALL have proper TypeScript types
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS7006 (implicit any type) errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all property access to be type-safe, so that runtime errors are prevented and IDE support is optimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing properties on mock objects THEN the system SHALL use properly typed mock interfaces
2. WHEN accessing environment variables THEN the system SHALL handle undefined values appropriately
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS2339 (property does not exist) errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type assignments to be compatible, so that data integrity is maintained and runtime errors are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning null values THEN the system SHALL only assign to types that accept null
2. WHEN working with optional properties THEN the system SHALL handle undefined values correctly
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS2322 (type not assignable) errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function calls to have correct parameter counts and types, so that the application behaves as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling functions with callbacks THEN the system SHALL provide the correct number of parameters
2. WHEN using Promise resolve functions THEN the system SHALL handle parameter requirements correctly
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS2345 (argument not assignable) errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all class property access to respect visibility modifiers, so that encapsulation is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing class properties THEN the system SHALL only access public properties from external code
2. WHEN working with protected properties THEN the system SHALL access them only from within the class hierarchy
3. WHEN the codebase is compiled THEN it SHALL NOT report any TS2445 (protected property access) errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality to remain intact after error fixes, so that no regressions are introduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript errors are fixed THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN code is refactored for type safety THEN the application behavior SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN compilation is successful THEN all features SHALL work as before the fixes
