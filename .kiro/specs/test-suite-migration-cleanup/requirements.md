# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the completion of the Jest to Vitest migration for the Signal-360 project. A previous migration attempt was incomplete, leaving 18 files with Jest syntax that need to be converted to Vitest. This is a critical technical debt item that must be resolved to ensure consistent testing infrastructure and prevent build/test failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to use consistent Vitest syntax, so that the test suite runs reliably without Jest dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the entire codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all remaining instances of Jest syntax in test files
2. WHEN Jest syntax is found THEN the system SHALL locate files containing `jest.mock`, `jest.fn`, `jest.spyOn`, and `jest.useFakeTimers`
3. WHEN identifying Jest syntax THEN the system SHALL focus specifically on files ending in `.test.ts`, `.test.tsx`, `.spec.ts`, or `.spec.tsx`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Jest syntax converted to Vitest equivalents, so that tests use the correct testing framework APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting Jest syntax THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.mock` with `vi.mock`
2. WHEN converting Jest syntax THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.fn` with `vi.fn`
3. WHEN converting Jest syntax THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.spyOn` with `vi.spyOn`
4. WHEN converting Jest syntax THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.useFakeTimers` with `vi.useFakeTimers`
5. WHEN converting syntax THEN the system SHALL ensure proper `vi` imports are added to each modified file
6. WHEN adding imports THEN the system SHALL use `import { vi } from 'vitest'` format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation that the migration is complete, so that no Jest syntax remains in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL perform a final search for `jest.` namespace across the entire project
2. WHEN performing final validation THEN the search SHALL return zero results for Jest syntax
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL identify any remaining Jest references and their locations
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm complete migration success

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of migrated files, so that I can track which files have been updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test file is migrated THEN the system SHALL add a comment at the top stating "// Migrated to Vitest"
2. WHEN adding documentation THEN the comment SHALL be placed after existing imports but before test code
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of all modified files
4. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include the count of files migrated and validation results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to preserve existing test functionality, so that all tests continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating syntax THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing test logic and assertions
2. WHEN converting mocks THEN the system SHALL maintain equivalent functionality between Jest and Vitest APIs
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN all existing test cases SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN syntax is converted THEN the system SHALL not modify test descriptions, expectations, or business logic
