# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Predictive Ticker Search System is designed to implement a predictive search (autocomplete) feature for stock tickers, creating a fluid, error-preventing user experience. This system will use a hybrid API architecture: the Finnhub API for real-time search suggestions and the Google API for subsequent in-depth analysis. The implementation must be robust, secure, and seamlessly integrated into the existing dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an investor using Signal-360, I want to search for stock tickers with predictive autocomplete suggestions, so that I can quickly find and select the correct ticker without typing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the ticker search input THEN the system SHALL display autocomplete suggestions after a 300ms debounce delay
2. WHEN I continue typing THEN the system SHALL update the suggestions based on my current input
3. WHEN I select a ticker from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL populate the input field with the selected ticker
4. WHEN I select a ticker THEN the system SHALL communicate this selection to the parent component for analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the ticker search to use a secure proxy architecture, so that API keys are protected and not exposed to the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs ticker suggestions THEN the system SHALL call a Supabase Edge Function proxy instead of calling Finnhub API directly
2. WHEN the Edge Function receives a search request THEN it SHALL retrieve the Finnhub API key from environment secrets
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL NOT expose or hardcode any API keys in the frontend code
4. WHEN the Edge Function calls Finnhub API THEN it SHALL format the response into a standardized JSON structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ticker search component to be reusable and well-integrated, so that it can be easily maintained and potentially used in other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the search component THEN it SHALL be created as a reusable React component in the appropriate directory structure
2. WHEN integrating with DashboardPage THEN it SHALL replace the existing simple input field
3. WHEN a ticker is selected THEN the component SHALL trigger the existing Google API analysis flow
4. WHEN the component is used THEN it SHALL maintain proper separation of concerns between search and analysis functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the ticker search interface to be responsive and visually consistent, so that I have a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the search on any device THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and functional
2. WHEN viewing the search results THEN they SHALL be styled consistently with the existing application design using Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN the search is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
4. WHEN there are no results or errors THEN the system SHALL display clear feedback messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the application, I want clear environment variable configuration, so that I can properly configure API keys for both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up local development THEN the system SHALL use FINNHUB_API_KEY from .env.local file
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use FINNHUB_API_KEY from Supabase project secrets
3. WHEN the .env.local file is created THEN it SHALL be included in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user typing in the search field, I want the system to handle my input efficiently, so that I don't experience lag or excessive API calls while typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type continuously THEN the system SHALL debounce API calls with a 300ms delay
2. WHEN I stop typing THEN the system SHALL trigger the search after the debounce period
3. WHEN I type very quickly THEN the system SHALL cancel previous pending requests to avoid race conditions
4. WHEN the API is slow or fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user interacting with search results, I want intuitive keyboard and mouse navigation, so that I can efficiently select tickers using my preferred input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN I SHALL be able to navigate them using arrow keys
2. WHEN I press Enter on a highlighted result THEN the system SHALL select that ticker
3. WHEN I click on a search result THEN the system SHALL select that ticker
4. WHEN I press Escape THEN the system SHALL close the dropdown without selecting anything
