# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core "Happy Path" Implementation

### Backend Task 1: Implement Asynchronous Analysis Flow with Basic Fundamental Analysis

**Title**: Create asynchronous analysis endpoints and basic Google API integration

**Description**: Implement the foundational asynchronous analysis flow with secure API key retrieval and basic fundamental analysis using real Google API data. This establishes the core architecture pattern that will be extended in later phases.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 1.1 Create `POST /start-analysis` endpoint that accepts ticker and context parameters
  - Validate user authentication and ticker format
  - Generate unique jobId for tracking analysis progress
  - Store initial job status in database with "pending" state
  - Return jobId to client for polling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 1.2 Create `GET /analysis-status/{jobId}` endpoint for progress tracking
  - Validate jobId exists and belongs to authenticated user
  - Return current job status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
  - Include progress percentage and current analysis phase
  - Return full results when status is "completed"
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 1.3 Implement secure API key retrieval service
  - Create function to decrypt user's Google API key from database
  - Validate API key format and basic functionality
  - Implement in-memory key caching with automatic cleanup
  - Add error handling for missing or invalid API keys
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 1.4 Create basic GoogleApiClient for fundamental data
  - Implement Google Custom Search API integration for company data
  - Add Alpha Vantage fallback for financial statements and ratios
  - Create retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
  - Implement basic rate limiting and error handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 1.5 Enhance fundamental analysis engine with real data
  - Modify existing fundamental-analysis function to use GoogleApiClient
  - Parse real financial data and calculate actual ratios
  - Generate analysis factors based on real financial metrics
  - Maintain existing scoring algorithm but use real data inputs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.6_

- [ ] 1.6 Update synthesis engine for fundamental-only processing
  - Create simplified synthesis that processes only fundamental analysis
  - Generate basic convergence/divergence factors from real data
  - Calculate synthesis score using fundamental analysis only
  - Return structured response matching existing format
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6_

- [ ] 1.7 Implement job status tracking and result storage
  - Create database schema for analysis jobs and results
  - Update job status throughout analysis pipeline
  - Store final analysis results with proper user association
  - Implement automatic cleanup of old job records
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.7, 6.4_

### Frontend Task 2: Integrate Asynchronous Analysis Flow

**Title**: Update dashboard to use real-time analysis with polling mechanism

**Description**: Modify the frontend dashboard to trigger real analysis when users select tickers and display real results using an asynchronous polling pattern. This replaces the current mock data flow with actual backend integration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 2.1 Update ticker selection to trigger real analysis
  - Modify TickerInput component to call start-analysis endpoint on selection
  - Handle authentication errors and redirect to login if needed
  - Display immediate feedback when analysis request is submitted
  - Store jobId in component state for tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement analysis progress polling mechanism
  - Create polling service that calls analysis-status endpoint every 2 seconds
  - Handle network errors and implement retry logic for polling
  - Stop polling when analysis completes or fails
  - Manage polling lifecycle to prevent memory leaks
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 2.3 Create enhanced loading indicator with progress tracking
  - Replace simple loading spinner with detailed progress indicator
  - Show current analysis phase (API key validation, data fetching, analysis, synthesis)
  - Display progress percentage when available from backend
  - Include estimated time remaining based on typical analysis duration
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 2.4 Update results display components for real data
  - Modify ResultsView component to handle real synthesis scores and factors
  - Update AnalysisChart component to display real convergence/divergence factors
  - Ensure proper formatting of real financial data and ratios
  - Add data source attribution and timestamp information
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7_

- [ ] 2.5 Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Display user-friendly error messages for API key issues
  - Show specific guidance for resolving common problems
  - Provide retry button for failed analyses
  - Handle partial results and indicate data limitations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 2.6 Add basic caching for completed analyses
  - Cache completed analysis results in browser storage
  - Show cached results immediately while checking for updates
  - Implement cache expiration based on analysis age
  - Provide manual refresh option for users
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5_
