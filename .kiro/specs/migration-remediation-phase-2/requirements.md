# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the migration of the remaining 6 Jest test files that were missed in the initial test suite migration. The objective is to complete the migration from Jest to Vitest syntax, ensuring zero active Jest syntax remains in the codebase. This is a critical remediation phase to achieve full test suite consistency and eliminate technical debt from the incomplete migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all remaining Jest test files migrated to Vitest syntax, so that the codebase has consistent testing framework usage and no mixed syntax remains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all 6 identified Jest test files SHALL be converted to Vitest syntax
2. WHEN a comprehensive scan is performed THEN the system SHALL return zero active Jest syntax in source code files
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN all migrated tests SHALL pass with Vitest runner
4. WHEN Jest-specific imports are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with equivalent Vitest imports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migrated test files to maintain their original test coverage and functionality, so that no regression is introduced during the migration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are migrated THEN all existing test cases SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN test assertions are converted THEN they SHALL maintain equivalent functionality in Vitest
3. WHEN mocking is used THEN Jest mocks SHALL be converted to Vitest equivalents
4. WHEN async tests exist THEN they SHALL work correctly with Vitest's async handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper validation of the migration completion, so that I can be confident no Jest syntax remains in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN a validation scan SHALL be performed across all source files
2. WHEN Jest syntax is detected THEN the validation SHALL fail and report the specific locations
3. WHEN validation passes THEN a completion report SHALL be generated
4. WHEN the scan completes THEN it SHALL confirm zero Jest imports, describe blocks, or Jest-specific methods remain

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to handle edge cases and complex test scenarios, so that all test functionality is preserved regardless of complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex mocking scenarios exist THEN they SHALL be properly converted to Vitest equivalents
2. WHEN custom Jest matchers are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with Vitest alternatives or custom implementations
3. WHEN test setup/teardown hooks exist THEN they SHALL be converted to appropriate Vitest lifecycle methods
4. WHEN snapshot testing is used THEN it SHALL be migrated to Vitest snapshot functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation of the migration process and any issues encountered, so that future migrations can benefit from lessons learned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is performed THEN each file conversion SHALL be documented with before/after changes
2. WHEN issues are encountered THEN they SHALL be logged with resolution steps
3. WHEN migration completes THEN a summary report SHALL detail all changes made
4. WHEN validation fails THEN specific error locations and remediation steps SHALL be provided
