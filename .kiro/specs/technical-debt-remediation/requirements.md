# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical technical debt in the Signal-360 project related to TypeScript configuration and Jest testing setup. The project currently has over 500 TypeScript errors preventing successful builds, which blocks AI agents from validating their work and impedes development velocity. This remediation effort will establish a stable development environment with proper TypeScript and Jest configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript configuration to be properly set up for a modern React with Vite project, so that the build process completes successfully without configuration-related errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tsconfig.json file is reviewed THEN it SHALL contain all required compiler options for React with Vite
2. WHEN "target" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to "ES2020"
3. WHEN "module" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to "ESNext"
4. WHEN "lib" is configured THEN it SHALL include ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]
5. WHEN "jsx" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to "react-jsx" to resolve JSX syntax errors
6. WHEN "esModuleInterop" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to true to resolve import errors with recharts and react
7. WHEN "allowSyntheticDefaultImports" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to true
8. WHEN "moduleResolution" is configured THEN it SHALL be set to "bundler"
9. WHEN "strict" mode is enabled THEN it SHALL be set to true for type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Jest testing configuration to be properly set up, so that test files can access Jest globals without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jest configuration is reviewed THEN @types/jest SHALL be installed as a devDependency
2. WHEN tsconfig.json is configured for testing THEN "jest" SHALL be included in the types array
3. WHEN test files are compiled THEN they SHALL NOT produce "Cannot use namespace 'jest' as a value" errors
4. WHEN Jest globals are used in tests THEN TypeScript SHALL recognize describe, it, expect, and other Jest functions
5. WHEN test files use .test.tsx extension THEN they SHALL be properly typed and compiled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute an iterative error correction process, so that all TypeScript build errors are systematically resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration fixes are applied THEN npm run build SHALL be executed to identify remaining errors
2. WHEN TypeScript errors are identified THEN they SHALL be categorized by type and priority
3. WHEN code-specific errors are found THEN they SHALL be fixed with minimal impact to existing functionality
4. WHEN the correction process is complete THEN npm run build SHALL complete with zero errors
5. WHEN npx tsc --noEmit is executed THEN it SHALL complete without any type checking errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error analysis and reporting, so that I can understand the scope and nature of TypeScript issues before remediation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial diagnostic is run THEN it SHALL capture and categorize all existing TypeScript errors
2. WHEN errors are categorized THEN they SHALL be grouped by configuration issues, import/export issues, type definition issues, and Jest-related issues
3. WHEN the error report is generated THEN it SHALL include error counts by category and file
4. WHEN priority is assigned THEN configuration errors SHALL be addressed before code-specific errors
5. WHEN progress is tracked THEN error count reduction SHALL be measurable after each correction phase

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build environment to be stable and reliable, so that AI agents can validate their work and development can proceed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the remediation is complete THEN npm run build SHALL consistently succeed
2. WHEN new code is added THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL provide accurate type checking
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute without TypeScript compilation errors
4. WHEN AI agents generate code THEN they SHALL be able to validate their work through successful builds
5. WHEN the project is set up on a new machine THEN the build process SHALL work without additional configuration
