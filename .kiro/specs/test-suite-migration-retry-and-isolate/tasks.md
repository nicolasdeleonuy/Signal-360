# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Phase 1: Isolate and Fix Problematic File
  - Target the specific file that caused the previous migration failure
  - Apply Jest to Vitest syntax transformations
  - Validate the fix works before proceeding
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6_

- [x] 1.1 Read and analyze the problematic test file
  - Read the contents of `src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx`
  - Identify all instances of Jest syntax that need migration
  - Document current import statements and mock usage
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 1.2 Apply Jest to Vitest syntax transformations to target file
  - Replace all `jest.mock(...)` calls with `vi.mock(...)`
  - Replace all `jest.fn(...)` calls with `vi.fn(...)`
  - Add `import { vi } from 'vitest';` at the top of the file if not present
  - Preserve all existing test logic and behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 1.3 Execute targeted test validation for Phase 1
  - Run the specific test command: `npm test -- src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx`
  - Verify the test passes successfully with zero failures
  - Capture and analyze any error output if the test fails
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6_

- [x] 2. Phase 2: Complete Full Migration (Only after Phase 1 success)
  - Apply the validated migration approach to all remaining test files
  - Execute full test suite validation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 2.1 Discover all remaining test files in src directory
  - Search for all files ending in `.test.ts` and `.test.tsx` within `/src` directory
  - Exclude the already-migrated `src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx` file
  - Create a list of files that need migration
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [x] 2.2 Apply Jest to Vitest migrations to all remaining test files
  - For each discovered test file, apply the same transformations used in Phase 1
  - Replace `jest.mock(...)` with `vi.mock(...)` in each file
  - Replace `jest.fn(...)` with `vi.fn(...)` in each file
  - Ensure `import { vi } from 'vitest';` is present in each file
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 2.3 Execute full test suite validation
  - Run the complete test suite using `npm test`
  - Verify that all tests pass with zero failing tests
  - Document any failing tests and their error messages
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 2.7_

- [x] 3. Final Validation and Safeguards
  - Ensure migration compliance with safety requirements
  - Verify no non-test files were modified
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 3.1 Verify migration safety and compliance
  - Confirm that only `.test.ts` and `.test.tsx` files were modified
  - Validate that no non-test files were altered during the migration process
  - Ensure test logic remains unchanged, only syntax was modified
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3.2 Generate migration completion report
  - Document all files that were successfully migrated
  - Report any files that failed migration and the reasons
  - Confirm final test suite status with zero failures
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_
