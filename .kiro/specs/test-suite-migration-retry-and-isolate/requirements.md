# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the migration of the test suite from Jest to Vitest syntax, using a two-phase approach to minimize risk and ensure successful completion. The previous migration attempt was aborted while editing `src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx`, so this retry focuses on isolating the problematic file first before proceeding with the full migration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to successfully migrate the problematic test file from Jest to Vitest syntax, so that I can validate the migration approach before applying it to all test files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration process begins THEN the system SHALL target only the file `src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx` in Phase 1
2. WHEN migrating the target file THEN the system SHALL replace all instances of `jest.mock(...)` with `vi.mock(...)`
3. WHEN migrating the target file THEN the system SHALL replace all instances of `jest.fn(...)` with `vi.fn(...)`
4. WHEN migrating the target file THEN the system SHALL ensure the import `import { vi } from 'vitest';` is present at the top of the file
5. WHEN Phase 1 migration is complete THEN the system SHALL execute the targeted test command `npm test -- src/pages/__tests__/sign-up-integration.test.tsx`
6. WHEN the targeted test runs THEN the system SHALL verify that the test passes successfully before proceeding to Phase 2

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to apply the validated migration approach to all remaining test files, so that the entire test suite uses Vitest syntax consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Phase 1 is successfully validated THEN the system SHALL proceed to migrate all other files ending in `.test.ts` and `.test.tsx` within the `/src` directory
2. WHEN migrating each remaining test file THEN the system SHALL apply the same migration logic used in Phase 1
3. WHEN migrating each file THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.mock(...)` with `vi.mock(...)`
4. WHEN migrating each file THEN the system SHALL replace `jest.fn(...)` with `vi.fn(...)`
5. WHEN migrating each file THEN the system SHALL ensure the necessary Vitest imports are present
6. WHEN all files are migrated THEN the system SHALL execute the full test suite using `npm test`
7. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN the system SHALL verify that all tests pass with zero failing tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strict safeguards during the migration process, so that only test syntax is changed without affecting test logic or non-test files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing any migration THEN the system SHALL NOT alter any non-test files
2. WHEN migrating test files THEN the system SHALL NOT change the logical behavior of the tests
3. WHEN migrating test files THEN the system SHALL only modify the API syntax for the test runner
4. WHEN encountering files that are not `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` THEN the system SHALL skip those files
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that only test runner syntax has been changed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear validation checkpoints between phases, so that I can ensure each phase is successful before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Phase 1 is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the targeted test passes
2. WHEN the targeted test fails THEN the system SHALL halt the process and report the failure
3. WHEN Phase 2 is complete THEN the system SHALL run the full test suite as final validation
4. WHEN any test fails in the final validation THEN the system SHALL report which tests are failing
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL consider the migration task complete
