# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete and secure user authentication system for the Signal-360 React application using Supabase as the backend service. The system will provide user registration, login, session management, and route protection capabilities while adhering to modern security best practices and the project's technology stack.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password, so that I can access the Signal-360 platform and manage my investment analysis data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-up page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email and password input fields
2. WHEN a user enters a valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new account in Supabase
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user enters a password that doesn't meet security requirements THEN the system SHALL display password validation errors
5. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their profile page
6. WHEN account creation fails THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message from Supabase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log into my account with my email and password, so that I can access my personalized dashboard and analysis tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email and password input fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them through Supabase
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their profile page
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN a user enters invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
6. WHEN a user leaves required fields empty THEN the system SHALL display required field errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view my profile information, so that I can verify my account details and manage my settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the profile page THEN the system SHALL display their email address
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the profile page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
3. WHEN a user is on the profile page THEN the system SHALL provide a logout option
4. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL end their session and redirect to the login page
5. IF the user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect them to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be securely managed, so that my account remains protected and I don't have to repeatedly log in during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session using Supabase authentication
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the application THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state if the session is still valid
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out and redirect to the login page
4. WHEN a user manually logs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their session
5. IF there are authentication errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want protected routes to be secure, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses a protected route THEN the system SHALL allow access to the content
3. WHEN a user's session becomes invalid while on a protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
4. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update route access permissions immediately
5. IF there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL handle authentication checks gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly with the existing React application architecture, so that it follows established patterns and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL use React Context API for global authentication state management
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use axios as specified in the technology stack
3. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL follow the established project structure and naming conventions
4. WHEN handling routing THEN the system SHALL use react-router-dom for navigation
5. WHEN managing environment variables THEN the system SHALL follow secure configuration practices for Supabase credentials
