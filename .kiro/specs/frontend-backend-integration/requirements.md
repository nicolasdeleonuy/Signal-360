# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a robust connection between the existing React frontend and the refactored Supabase backend Edge Functions for Signal-360. The integration will enable users to perform 360-degree financial analysis by inputting a stock ticker and receiving comprehensive analysis results through a secure, asynchronous communication layer. The implementation must adhere to the established technology stack using React, TypeScript, Supabase, and axios for HTTP requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to securely connect to the Supabase backend so that I can access the analysis services without exposing sensitive configuration details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL verify the existence of a Supabase client at `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`
2. IF the Supabase client does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it using environment variables `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL ensure the `.env.local` file exists and is included in `.gitignore`
4. WHEN the Supabase client is initialized THEN it SHALL be properly configured to communicate with the backend Edge Functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated API service layer so that all backend communications are centralized and maintainable with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API service is implemented THEN the system SHALL create a new file at `src/lib/apiService.ts`
2. WHEN the API service is created THEN it SHALL implement a function `getAnalysisForTicker(ticker: string)`
3. WHEN `getAnalysisForTicker` is called THEN it SHALL use the Supabase client to securely invoke the primary Edge Function for 360-degree analysis
4. IF the Edge Function invocation fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and return meaningful error messages
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use axios for HTTP requests as specified in the technology stack

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a stock ticker and trigger the analysis so that I can receive comprehensive financial insights without manual backend interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a ticker in the primary input component THEN the system SHALL call the `getAnalysisForTicker` function
2. WHEN the analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL use React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
3. WHEN the analysis starts THEN the system SHALL set a `loading` state to true
4. WHEN the analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store results in a `data` state
5. IF the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL store error information in an `error` state
6. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL re-render the appropriate UI components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback during the analysis process so that I understand the current status of my request and any issues that may occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner or indicator
2. WHEN the analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL hide the loading indicator
3. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN error messages are shown THEN they SHALL be clear and actionable for the user
5. WHEN the loading state changes THEN the UI SHALL update immediately to reflect the current status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the analysis results displayed on the dashboard so that I can review the comprehensive financial data for my selected ticker.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL render results within the Dashboard/Analysis Screen
2. WHEN displaying initial results THEN the system SHALL show the raw JSON response to confirm successful connection
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL be rendered within appropriate UI components
4. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly clean up any pending requests or subscriptions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration to follow established project conventions so that the code is maintainable and consistent with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the integration THEN the system SHALL follow all conventions defined in `tech.md`
2. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL follow the structure defined in `structure.md`
3. WHEN writing TypeScript code THEN it SHALL use proper typing and interfaces
4. WHEN implementing React components THEN they SHALL use functional components with hooks
5. WHEN handling asynchronous operations THEN the system SHALL use proper async/await patterns
6. WHEN implementing error boundaries THEN they SHALL follow React best practices for error handling
