# Test Shield - Automated QA Suite

## Overview

The Test Shield is a comprehensive automated testing suite designed to ensure Signal-360 remains stable, reliable, and cost-effective during development. All tests are designed to run without making live API calls to external services.

## Test Architecture

### 1. Mocking Strategy

- **Analysis Service Mock**: Intercepts all calls to `analysisService.ts` and returns realistic mock data
- **Supabase Mock**: Prevents live database calls during testing
- **Router Mock**: Provides navigation testing without actual routing

### 2. Test Categories

#### Integration Tests (`src/test/integration/`)
- **test-shield.test.tsx**: Core application functionality tests
- **critical-user-paths.test.tsx**: End-to-end user flow tests

#### Unit Tests (`src/test/unit/`)
- **hooks.test.ts**: Analysis hooks testing
- **components.test.tsx**: UI component testing

#### Mock Data (`src/test/mocks/`)
- **analysisServiceMock.ts**: Realistic API response mocks

## Test Coverage

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Dashboard rendering and interaction
- ✅ Ticker search functionality
- ✅ Opportunity discovery features
- ✅ Authentication state management
- ✅ Credit system integration

### Analysis Hooks
- ✅ `useSignalAnalysis` hook behavior
- ✅ `useOpportunitySearch` hook behavior
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ State management and cleanup

### Mock Validation
- ✅ Analysis service mocks properly configured
- ✅ Supabase mocks prevent live calls
- ✅ Realistic mock data structure validation

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Integration tests only
npm test -- --run src/test/integration/

# Unit tests only  
npm test -- --run src/test/unit/

# Test Shield core functionality
npm test -- --run src/test/integration/test-shield.test.tsx

# Analysis hooks only
npm test -- --run src/test/unit/hooks.test.ts
```

### Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Fast Execution**: All tests run in under 2 seconds
2. **Cost-Free**: No live API calls to external services
3. **Reliable**: Consistent results with mocked dependencies
4. **Comprehensive**: Covers critical user paths and edge cases
5. **Maintainable**: Clear structure and realistic mock data

## Mock Data Structure

The mock analysis response includes:
- Market data (company name, current price)
- Investment verdict (synthesis score, factors)
- Fundamental analysis (business model, financial ratios)
- Sentiment analysis (market sentiment, key echoes)
- Technical analysis (trends, support/resistance levels)

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments without external dependencies:
- No API keys required for testing
- No network calls during test execution
- Deterministic results across environments

## Future Enhancements

- Visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Accessibility testing automation
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
