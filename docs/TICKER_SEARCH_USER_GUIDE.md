# Ticker Search User Guide

The Signal-360 platform features an intelligent ticker search system that helps you quickly find and select stock symbols for analysis.

## Overview

The predictive ticker search provides real-time suggestions as you type, making it easy to find the exact stock you want to analyze. The system searches through thousands of publicly traded companies and provides instant results with company names, ticker symbols, and exchange information.

## How to Use Ticker Search

### Basic Search

1. **Start Typing**: Begin typing in the search box on the dashboard
2. **View Suggestions**: Suggestions appear automatically as you type
3. **Select Ticker**: Click on any suggestion to select it
4. **Begin Analysis**: The selected ticker will be used for your financial analysis

### Search Tips

#### By Ticker Symbol
- Type the stock symbol directly (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL")
- Most effective for known symbols
- Provides fastest and most accurate results

#### By Company Name
- Type the company name (e.g., "Apple", "Microsoft", "Google")
- Useful when you know the company but not the ticker
- May take slightly longer to load results

#### Partial Matching
- You don't need to type the complete name or symbol
- "App" will show Apple Inc. (AAPL)
- "Micro" will show Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)

## Error Handling

### No Results Found
If no results appear for your search:

- **Try Variations**: Use different abbreviations or full names
- **Manual Entry**: You can still enter the ticker manually and proceed

### Network Issues
If the search isn't working:

- **Check Connection**: Ensure you have internet connectivity
- **Retry**: The system automatically retries failed requests
- **Manual Entry**: Enter the ticker directly if search is unavailable

### Rate Limiting
If you see rate limiting messages:

- **Wait**: The system will automatically retry after a brief delay
- **Slow Down**: Reduce typing speed to avoid hitting limits

## Best Practices

### For Fastest Results
1. Use official ticker symbols when known
2. Type at a normal pace (avoid rapid typing)
3. Select from suggestions rather than typing full names

### For Accuracy
1. Verify the company name matches your intended stock
2. Check the exchange if multiple listings exist
3. Use the most recent ticker symbol (some companies change symbols)

### For Accessibility
1. Use keyboard navigation when possible
2. Enable screen reader if needed
3. Use high contrast mode if available
